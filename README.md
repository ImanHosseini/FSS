Fast Screen Server: A tcp server, sending screen in real-time. <br>
The trick to making this *really* fast is not to use **ScreenCapture** or other similar methods, but instead using **SharpDX** which is DirectX API (sadly no longer maintained) to get the frame buffer right from display memory. (I used this trick for a project and it sped up the server by an order of magnitude) The architecture is also designed with consideration for real-time purposes: based on producer-consumer pattern, there are two threads sharing a queue data structure, the capture thread captures screen and enqueues frames and the network thread simultaneously dequeues and sends away the frames.
